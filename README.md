## Introduction
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game where players attempt to reach a score of 21 â€” without exceeding it and losing the hand. You win the hand if you don't bust and your total is higher than the dealers cards.

The player creates an account to get their game chips and places bets on blackjack hands against an automated dealer. Any winnings can be stored in the players account to bet with next time they play the game.

* User can quit the game when they want.

### User Manual
Click the dropdown to view the user manual:
<details>
<summary>User Manual</summary>

### Sign In/Sign Up
When the program starts, the user will be prompted to either:
* Enter their existing login.
* Sign up for a new account.
This choice is navigated by inputting Y or N on the keyboard and pressing enter to submit.

The user will then enter their account details to sign in, or enter a new username and password to create an account and sign in. Correct case sensitive user details must be entered to validate account access.

### Main Menu
The useer will be taken to the game menu where they will see their chips balance and be given three options:
* Enter I to see game instructions
* Enter S to start the game
* Enter X to exit the game

### Game Instructions
If I is selected at the main menu, a screen detailing game instructions will appear.
The user can proceed to the game or return to the main menu.

### Play Game
When the user starts the game, they will:
* Be taken to a betting screen where they can see their chips balance and place a bet.
* Continue to the game screen where they can see their first two cards and one of the dealers cards. The user then has three possible moves:
    * Enter H to hit and draw another card
    * Enter D to double down on their bet and draw another card
    * Enter S to stand and take no more cards
* The dealer makes their move and the game continues in turn until one player busts or both players take no more cards, reveal their cards and the game result is evaluated.
* Once the result has been evaluated the chips will be added to or taken from the users chips balance, the user can then play another round or quit the game.
* If a user loses all their chips, they will be prompted to press any key to get more chips and 5000 chips will be added to their account so they can continue to play.
    
### Exit Game
The user can exit the game by inputting X in the main menu or EXIT before placing a new bet. User will be asked if they are sure they want to exit the game:
* Enter Y to exit the game.
* Enter N to go to the game menu.

### User Stories
#### First Time User
1. As a first time user, I want to set a username and password to sign up for a game account.
2. As a first time user, I want to see clear instructions on how to play the game before starting.
3. As a first time user, I want to have a visual representation of the Blackjack game as I am playing it.
4. As a first time user, I want inputs to work as expected and any errors to be flagged by the program.
5. As a first time user, I want the program to be responsive and provide clear progress and feedback through the steps of the game.

#### Returning User 
6. As a returning user, I want to be able to log in with my existing username and password.
7. As a returning user, I want to be able to continue the game with my previous chips balance.
8. As a returning user, I want to be able skip the instructions if they I'm already familiar with the game.

#### Site Owner
9. As a site owner, I want to ensure that all data entered by the user is validated so as not to break the program or create bad user experience.
10. As a site owner, I want to ensure that all user actions are given feedback in the terminal so that users know what to do next in the game.

## Technical Design
### Flowchart
A flowchart was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) to visualise the logic flow of the game.

    <p>Blackjack game logic:</p>
    <img src="docs/technical-design/flowchart.png" alt="A screenshot of the flowchart of game logic">
</details><br>

### Data Models
* Dictionaries were used to store user data.
    * This was used to verify user details when signing up and signing into the game and to keep a running balance of game chips for each user.
* Lists of tuples were used to format the card layout.
    * These lists could then be iterated through at random to make player and dealer hands.
* The Google Sheets API was used for user data.
    * This allows user data to be saved so a user can create an account and use it to sign in to the game.

### Feature Ideas for Future Development
In future the website could be further developed and improved to offer more games and expand into a general casino-type application, with additional games such as poker, roulette and slot machine games.

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
Python

### Other Tools Used
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used for saving and storing files.
* [CodeAnywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) was the IDE used for writing and editing code.
* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) was used as the hosting platform for this site.
* [ASCII art generator](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Big%20Money-ne&t=Blackjack) was used to generate title text.
* [PEP8 Python Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) Code institute's own Python Linter was used to validate all Python code in this project.
* [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) was used to create logic flowchart.
* [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was used to test the website across different screens and generate the picture at the head of this file.

### 3rd Party Python Libraries Used
* [Gspread / Google Sheets API](https://github.com/burnash/gspread) was used to handle getting/sending data to the google sheet used in the project. This is also not a standard feature of python, so it was necessary to install it for the purposes of this project.
* [Google OAuth 2.0](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/google.oauth2.credentials.html) was used to set up the connection between the project and the developers personal google account. This was necessary because access to a google account via a program is restricted for security reasons.

## Deployment & Local Development
The website was deployed to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) using the following process:
1. Login or create an account at [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku1.png">
2. Click on New > Create new app in the top right of the screen.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku2.png">
3. Add an app name and select location, then click 'create app'.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku3.png">
4. Under the deploy tab of the next page, select connect to GitHub.
5. Log in to your GitHub account when prompted.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku4.png">
6. Select the repository that you want to be connected to the Heroku app.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku5.png">
7. Click on the settings tab.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku6.png">
8. Scroll down to the config vars section, and add 2 config vars:
    * The first key is CREDS and the value here is the creds.json file that was generated for the google sheets API to work properly.
    * The second key is PORT and the Value is 8000
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku7.png">
9. Once you have set up the config vars, scroll down to buildpacks (still under the settings tab)
10. Add the Python and Node.js buildpacks to your app and make sure that when they are displayed, they appear in the order:
    * Python
    * Node.JS
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku8.png">
11. Navigate back to the settings tab.
12. Select automatic deploys to allow Heroku to build the site with new changes each time changes are pushed to GitHub.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku9.png">
13. In the 'manual deploy' section beneath this, make sure the branch selected is 'main' and click deploy branch.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku10.png">
14. The site should now be built and Heroku should provide a url for the built site.

This repository can be forked using the following process:
1. On the repository's page, go to the top-right of the page underneath the dark ribbon.
2. Click on the fork button
3. You can now work on a fork of this project.

### Bugs

| Bug Description  | Action Taken to Fix  |
|---|---|
|Between inputting their username and the password input loading, the user could input characters into empty lines, causing issues with login. | Remove time.sleep(1) from between the username and password inputs being loaded. |
| Validation issues when using "Press $ to get more chips". | Change input to "Press any button to get more chips". |
| When player clicks to get more chips, sometimes the sheet has not updated before the game restarts and the player has the wrong number of chips. | Insert time.sleep(3) in between the getChips and playBlackjack functions to allow time for the sheet to update. |
